I use it to keep me up during my night shifts as a security guard. I started noticing a very rancid smell. Like bad beans. I just recently changed my deodorant to a deodorant that usually helps my smell on my armpit so I thought it was my armpit still smelling. I would take drinks and put my arms up to take a swig and would smell it. So of course my brain is thinking that it's my armpits because I've been having problems with it. But then I put my jacket on to go through out trash and I took one last swig and notice the smell still. My armpit smell bad but not that bad that it goes right through the jacket. So I'm like what the f is this. So I start smelling my hands and I thought it was maybe my hands because maybe I've just been touching my armpit and not noticing. Well it definitely wasn't my hands so I started smelling the Coca-Cola bottle and I found the problem. The tip of the Coca-Cola bottle on the inside smells like bad BO. So I dumped it out and had already drank half of it. I started feeling a little nauseous maybe because of my own brain. But I puked because of the thought of the BO. Has anybody experienced anything like this??,0

Replace Coca-Cola spiced with Coca-Cola real sugar in 2025,62,1fowsid,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocacola/comments/1fowsid/replace_cocacola_spiced_with_cocacola_real_sugar/,29,9/25/2024 12:06,"Link: [Petition ¬∑ Coca-Cola to reinstate real sugar in American products or make throwbacks with real sugar - United States ¬∑ Change.org](https://www.change.org/p/coca-cola-to-reinstate-real-sugar-in-american-products-or-make-throwbacks-with-real-sugar)

With Coca-Cola Spiced officially discontinued due to poor sales and numerous complaints about its taste, it seems like Coca-Cola needs a comeback. Personally, I think the best way for them to redeem themselves would be to introduce **Coca-Cola made with real sugar**, similar to **Pepsi Throwback** or **Pepsi Real Sugar**.

In a statement, Coca-Cola addressed the discontinuation of Coca-Cola Spiced, saying:  
*""We‚Äôre always looking at what our customers like and adjusting our flavors accordingly. As part of this strategy, we‚Äôre planning to phase out Coca-Cola Spiced to introduce an exciting new flavor in 2025.""*  
‚Äî Coca-Cola spokesperson

While it‚Äôs great that Coca-Cola is listening to its consumers, I believe the perfect solution would be to bring back the classic taste with **real sugar**. What better way to win back loyal fans than to offer a throwback flavor that highlights the true essence of Coca-Cola?

Who‚Äôs with me? Would you be excited about Coca-Cola made with real sugar replacing Coca-Cola Spiced? if so please sign and share the petition to make it come true.

Yes I do know that their is Mexican Coke made with real sugar but at the same time I would like if their was a can version of real sugar Cola Cola.

Vanilla Coke Zero Search,4,1f6lkup,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocacola/comments/1f6lkup/vanilla_coke_zero_search/,10,9/2/2024 1:37,"*TLDR below*

Hi everyone! I‚Äôve used this thread to find information about Vanilla Coke Zero a few times. In some areas, like where I am, VCZ changed their packaging and then dropped off the face of the earth, costing almost triple the price to have a case shipped to you. However, with people filming their grocery trips on TikTok and with this thread, I‚Äôm seeing that in certain states, it is regularly available in the grocery stores at a normal price. 

Through my research I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs due to different suppliers that it isn‚Äôt accessible for some, but what I can‚Äôt find is in what state does one supplier end and the other begin? I am located in PA, and the closest I have found is Georgia! If you are located closer to PA than Georgia and have seen your grocery store constantly stocking Vanilla Coke Zero, I would love to know what state you‚Äôre in. My mom‚Äôs birthday is coming up, she used to be so addicted to it, talks about it all the time. How cool would it be to surprise her with a few months supply? (Weeks, we can be honest here.) Thank you so much in advance for any leads!! 

TLDR: Vanilla Coke Zero has been gone from Pennsylvania store shelves, but is accessible in other states. Looking for the closest state to PA with Vanilla Coke Zero consistently. ",0

What makes this bottle even more special is that it‚Äôs made from recycled plastic, in line with the Olympic Games‚Äô commitment to sustainability. It features the Paris 2024 Olympics and Paralympics logo and the Coca Cola logo as worldwide partner.

How to get a Coca Cola sponsored store sign / other merch?,50,1eykzr1,https://i.redd.it/wy2gb2eu88kd1.jpeg,13,8/22/2024 21:39,"
Hi üëã 

Does anyone have experience getting a Coca Cola sponsored store sign or other merch for your business? 

I‚Äôve been traveling around the world and I see them everywhere! I‚Äôm curious what the usual contractual arrangement is. Specifically:
1. Does Coca Cola pay the full cost of the sign? Do they ship it to you? Or do you get reimbursed for working with a local sign maker?
2. Is there an online website where you design the sign yourself or choose from a variety of options?
3. What does the contract usually stipulate in exchange for the sign? Can you only sell Coke?

I‚Äôm not a restaurant owner, just a curious customer! If you have any experience or stories I‚Äôd love to hear them! 

Thank you üôè

I buy the 16.9 oz bottles and cans for home. I drink 1 or 2 every day. Even when the bottle is still well within date it almost tastes flat. 

 I just bought two 20oz bottles from CVS well within date. Flat. Hardly any bubbles or hiss when I opened it up. I haven't even burped! 

I have noticed the plastic is thinner so maybe it's affecting the quality? Maybe the heat of summer in the south? I need some answers please! ",0

But the biggest evidence for this existing is an advertisement for the bottle which from what I see appears to be legit. ([Source](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh1uEmOv2LE))

California Raspberry Coca Cola,11,1ecw1e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocacola/comments/1ecw1e5/california_raspberry_coca_cola/,12,7/27/2024 2:00,"About 5-6 years ago, I always remember buying California Raspberry (and Georgia Peach, for that matter) glass bottle Coca Colas. They tasted incredible and the lack of HFCS made them easier to consume compared to other flavors offered in the US. 

Fast forward to 2020 around the start of Covid, and they suddenly started disappeared off shelves. About a year later, I saw that both the Peach and Raspberry were pretty much discontinued stateside. I was surprised, especially since both flavors were immensely popular and usually sold out of stores pretty quickly. It's not like they were poor-selling options by any means.

Well last week, while in Canada, I couldn't believe it when I found British Columbia Raspberry, packaged the same as the California Raspberry used to be in the US, inside a grocery store. The flavor is exactly what I remember it being here, and it's so incredible, that I'm tempted to pay a decent amount on Amazon to ship some more bottles here from Canada. Why can't we get flavors like this, especially ones with real sugar, here in the US!? ",0
Bad Dr Pepper cans advice,4,1ec95v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocacola/comments/1ec95v0/bad_dr_pepper_cans_advice/,3,7/26/2024 6:21,"Hi everyone, I recently bought 4x 24 cans of Dr pepper here in London, UK. I know this is a Coca Cola forum but when I complained it was Coca Cola who responded. Long story short the first can I opened had an off taste, hard to explain but I drink around 2/3 cans a day so know when it don‚Äôt taste right. That night I was quite ill with sickness and diharrea. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it until a few days later when I had another can. As soon as I opened it the smell of eggy/sulphuric hit me right away and poured it away. I then opened another can from a different crate of 24 and same smell came from the can. All 96 cans I bought had same expiry date of 25/04/25 so were clearly in date. I checked all serial numbers at bottom and although slightly different last 2 digits they all were same. No I opened around 15-20 and all had same issue. At this point I complained to Coca Cola and they sent out packaging for me to send samples and 3 cans to test. Nearly 6 weeks later they got back to me and this was explanation ;

‚ÄòAs part of our investigation, we have reviewed all our production records, checked the products we retain for quality purposes and looked at whether we have received any other complaints of this nature.

We have identified that a manufacturing issue has occurred during the filling process, which has resulted in a small number of consumers having purchased drinks that may appear to have a ‚Äòsulphurous‚Äô off taste or odour.

While we understand this will have been unpleasant, we have investigated thoroughly, and we can confirm that this is not a food safety matter.

We are very sorry that this happened and we have taken steps to ensure that something like this doesn‚Äôt happen again so that we can ensure our high quality standards are met.

Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention and giving us the opportunity to look into this further. I have arranged for some goodwill vouchers to be sent to you separately to your home address and can be used against any of our drinks. ‚Äò

Now bearing in mind I bought 96 cans and spent around ¬£55 on this and sent th proof of purchase and pictures of all the cans I received a note today in post, not addressed to me in person just saying ‚Äò thank you for contacting us as promised here is some goodwill vouchers ‚Äò I got 3x ¬£5 vouchers. Am I wrong in thinking this is terrible customer service and pathetic ‚Äò goodwill ‚Äò gesture? Any advice on what to do next?

As many of you know, Coca-Cola made in the US currently uses high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) instead of real sugar like the ones made in the UK or Mexico.

There are numerous reasons why many people, including myself, believe that returning to using real sugar would be a positive change. Whether it's for health reasons, taste preference, or supporting more natural ingredients, the benefits are clear.

I started a petition 5 months ago calling for Coca-Cola in the US to switch back to using sugar instead of HFCS. So far, we've gathered 103 signatures, but we need more support to make a real impact.

If this is a cause you believe in, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to sign the petition and share it with your friends and family.

If we make this trend, it will put Coca-Cola on notice thus resulted in real sugar to come back on Coca-Cola products served here in the US and US territories.",0

I know coke is unhealthy because of the sugar content alone. I'm asking this question because i'm mostly curious and artificial ingredients usually make me sick and nauseous.

The ingredient label (in my country) is very simple for (original) coke: Water, sugar, caramel color, *natural* flavors, caffeine and phosphoric acid (only synthetic ingredient but its not considered a flavor but more a preservative, and that does make my throat feel cold and itchy sometimes).

Do you think they actually use artifical flavors and hide it on their ingredient label someway or do you actually believe coca cola is naturally flavored? Same can be said with coke cherry which is even harder to believe.

powerade vs aquarius,2,1d1b5iz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocacola/comments/1d1b5iz/powerade_vs_aquarius/,6,5/27/2024 4:03,"So,

i remember 20-ish years ago i first discoverd powerade when abroad - it wasn't available in my country (and only has been for a short time now)  
the brand that was (and is) available, is aquarius - and according to coca-cola's marketing, they are ""replacing"" aquarius blue ice with powerade mountain blast, and ""they are the same"".

i however distinctly remember them being different, as i would go abroad specifically to get like 20 bottles of powerade because we only had aquarius here.

can someone tell me if i'm imagining this ?  
and, perhaps, if the formula for either one has been changed over the years to become the same? (haven't had aquarius in ages)

i guess i could go look for a store that still stocks the blue aquarius and compare, but it seems like the outphasing for blue has already been pretty much completed (and currently neither the blue aquarius or powerade seem to be available in shops near me)

"Coca-Cola's Scheme Of Awarding Honda City For Lucky Bottles Was Genuine Marketing Strategy, Aggrieved Consumer Eligible For Compensation: NCDRC",1,1cu4qmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocacola/comments/1cu4qmi/cocacolas_scheme_of_awarding_honda_city_for_lucky/,0,5/17/2024 20:08,"The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC), conducted by Mr.Subhash Chandra, newly viewed a case regarding Coca-Cola's promotional scheme. The promotion, began in September 1998, promised to distribute a variety of prizes, including five Honda City automobiles, for buyers of Coca-Cola bottles with special yellow-banded crowns. One consumer received such¬†yellow¬†banded crown bottle and¬†though¬†that he won a prize which would be¬†car¬†based on the liner in his bottle, he followed¬†the scheme's instructions and mailed his winning entry via postal to Coca-Cola. But soon his¬†expectation¬†turned into grievance when he received no¬†response from¬†company.

This led him to¬†sent¬†a legal notice to Coca-Cola, which also went unanswered. Frustrated with this situation, he filed a complaint with the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in Delhi. The State Commission set up Coca-Cola shamefaced of illegal trade practices, noting that the company only awarded 10- 15 prizes out of millions of bottles sold. This, they argued, was misleading and encouraged people to buy Coca-Cola. As a result, the State Commission ordered Coca-Cola to deposit Rs. 1 lakh in the State Consumer Welfare Fund and pay the consumer Rs. 25,000 as compensation.

Dissatisfied with the compensation amount, the consumer appealed to the NCDRC, seeking¬†a advanced¬†compensation and a directive for Coca-Cola to award him the promised Honda City car. The NCDRC admitted that the State Commission had determined Coca-Cola's scheme was an illegal trade practice. Still, they noted that the Delhi High Court had already declared the promotion legitimate, taking off any question of its legality. The NCDRC's primary focus was to determine if the consumer fell under the protection of the Consumer Protection Act, concluding that he did.

In a conclusion, the NCDRC overturned the State Commission's decision, declaring the promotion a valid marketing strategy and not fraudulent. Still, they honored the consumer‚Äôs genuine efforts to claim his prize and the stress caused by Coca- Cola's lack of response. To address this, the NCDRC directed Coca-Cola to pay the consumer Rs. 25,000 to cover action costs.

The new CEO RAM has had this plan for around 3-4 years now to ""optimize"" the business. Most of salaried personnel in our market was stretched thin now we are all.left to pick up the pieces our colleagues were canned with only a few of us remaining meaning 6 day work weeks 12 hour days. We also know that more positions will be laid off soon and that more facilties could be closing as well as positions being eliminated this Friday. Note: facilties closed so far Harrisburg, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Chicago, ",1

I was thinking of taking the unopened one back and going somewhere else. But I noticed the lot numbers are slightly different. Now I'm kind of genuinely curious how this breaks down. I did some searching and found info on the numbers but the ones I found were not the same format that I could tell.

Lot numbers are 1058GC092843 and 1114GC092843

Both has expiration dates of 6/30/25

Only the beginning is the different. I'm thinking this breaks down as: Line or Batch number - Plant - Manufacturer date

But using this format I can't figure out the date. Made on 09/28 but what is the 43? or is it the 92nd day of the year which would be April 2.

Anyone know for sure?

Thanks

A few months back had a really weird episode where a 1.25L bottle tasted off, it's hard to describe it was a weird taste with an even more horrible aftertaste, almost metallic.

Thought maybe my taste was off (had covid a year ago and it took me six months to taste M&M's again, they tasted like coffee afterward, yuck). Next day tried it again and it was foul, tipped it out and looked at the expiry date and it was fresh as can be.

Thought maybe something was up with me went and grabbed another bottle from coles when they opened, tasted great. Tossed the other bottle thought the servo maybe had stored it wrong?

Well few days ago purchased a bunch of 1.25's from woolies that were in the fridge and had been going through them and had one left, so last night grabbed 3x more from coles on the way home to get cold.

One from woolies tasted amazing, after finishing it cracked the one of the other 3x and it tasted absolutely disgusting. At a point to make my stomach in knots and wanting to throw up just from a mouthful. Horrible aftertaste, it reminded me of the one earlier that was off.

Just went to try the other two..... exact same thing, went to foodland down the road and got another, completely fine, tastes delicious.

I have no idea what is up with this has anyone else experienced this?

All of the bottles have fresh dates on them, all look fine, never had an issue buying from this coles before.",1

Rip our merchandisers,15,1fvdwcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1fvdwcf/rip_our_merchandisers/,62,10/4/2024 0:59,"Our company is about to screw a lot of our merchandisers. over 40% of our merchandiser shifts are being switched to overnight shifts (7p-3a) and the merchandisers are shitty as fuck about it. They‚Äôre starting a pilot program in the west side area and gonna run it for a month and see how it goes. and if it works how they‚Äôre hoping, it‚Äôll change in all the other areas too. With this, they‚Äôre also taking away all 6am start times and all morning shifts will be 5am start times.

Every single one of us thinks this is a terrible idea and don‚Äôt think it is going to workout for anyone. 

It‚Äôs mostly revolved around Krogers. Their plan is, they are going to have the overnight shift start at krogers, run the delivery there, blah blah blah, and then once they‚Äôre finished there they will do a second hit on Walmarts, Meijers, etc. And the opposite will go for morning shift (5/6a-1/2p). They will start their day at Walmart/Meijer and run their delivery there, blah blah blah, and end their day doing a second hit at the krogers. Ideally the last two hours of our shift is supposed to be dedicated to a second hit. 

Most people have a huge issues with this because we know that by the time the ‚Äúsecond hit‚Äù for the kroger comes around for the morning shift people‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not even going to be a second hit anymore. It‚Äôs going to be running an entire second store. This pisses a lot of people off because they finally got our routes set to where a lot of us have one store routes, because it‚Äôs a necessity, as it takes the whole day to run the delivery and keep restocking the shelves throughout the day. 
Me personally, i‚Äôve always had two stores since I started at pepsi, a meijer and a kroger, but I can definitely see why the people who have one store routes, that spend their entire day there‚Ä¶ are pissed off. 

Also would like to add, this is all being said as they‚Äôre limiting our overtime and telling us we NEED to be done in 8 hours. 

This is large format that I‚Äôm speaking about btw. Idk how it is effecting or if it is at all effecting small format. ",1

Pepsi Chronicles 1 ,16,1fqxqru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1fqxqru/pepsi_chronicles_1/,14,9/28/2024 3:47,"I am currently a sales rep for PepsiCo, which I must say is rewarding in many ways. There have been many odd occurrences on my route through the years and I wanted to share one. 

It was that part of the month again. I have a convenience store on my route that is in a remote area with nothing around for miles. The store itself is fairly small and it is very run down; most would think it wasn‚Äôt even open. The parking lot is mostly gravel with two gas pumps that don‚Äôt even work. It stands on the side of an old highway which hasn‚Äôt seen any kind of traffic for years. Mostly because there are better alternative routes. 

I slowly turned into the so called lot and my car was immediately met with bits of rocks and dust. Creeping over to the side of the building I parked my car began my pre visit protocols. Looking at my work phone I noticed I had a text message from my supervisor. It was from the previous day and he said he was going into the store to do a coffee reset. Excited to see the new set I jumped out of my car and headed inside. 

Walking into the store I wasn‚Äôt greeted at all. There was no one at the counter and not a person in sight, not even customers. I bee lined it to the cooler doors with the coffee. Upon inspection of the door I could tell the reset wasn‚Äôt done. Thinking he must have gotten busy with something else I took it upon myself to complete the task. Just as I was taking products out of the cooler I heard a deep, stern voice from behind me. 

‚ÄúHello, boss.‚Äù  The owner of the account was standing there. He was a tall middle eastern man with a caterpillar mustache and dark shorter hair. He wore glasses and always had a different plaid shirt on. Today it was a dark blue; buttoned up to perfection. As I stood from my kneeled position I greeted him and before I could ask if anything was wrong he interrupted me. 

‚ÄúWe do not like the reset, boss.‚Äù He spoke in an aggravated tone. 

Not seeing any reason to argue I told him I would keep it the same and he seemed pleased with the answer. I assumed that‚Äôs why my manager hadn‚Äôt completed it. Just as the man was calming down the back door, which was behind the counter with the register swung open. A younger individual stepped out of the back dragging what seemed to be a garbage bag behind him. The owner snapped his head back and seemed irritated again. 

‚ÄúCooler now‚Äù, he shouted from across the store. The younger man nodded and continued to drag the bag across the main aisle of the establishment; heading toward the cooler door. The main cooler was a small back room like space, so it seemed odd he was taking trash to it. As he struggled to pull it behind him it was leaving liquid like trail behind him. It looked red in tint and being an expert cook and grill specialist I knew it had to be some kind of meat. 

‚ÄúMeat‚Äù, I asked as I already knew the answer. 

The owner turned back to me and smiled, nodding his head. ‚ÄúYou must try our boss burgers.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm not really hungry,‚Äù I said politely. I really didn‚Äôt want to put my stomach through the pain of gas station food. Wanting to get back to the task at hand I changed the subject. ‚ÄúSorry my boss wanted this reset done but it‚Äôs not really that necessary.‚Äù

He smiled and agreed with my response. ‚ÄúDid you like the boss, boss?‚Äù  What an odd question to ask. Of course I would say I liked my manager.  I tried to laugh it off and he continued. ‚ÄúYou could be boss. I bet you have good taste.‚Äù  He then pulled a folded up piece of paper out of his pocket and handed it to me. ‚ÄúThese are what we need ordered.‚Äù

I quickly took the paper and thanked him. Feeling uneasy about the situation I put it in my pocket and awkwardly exited the store. In a hurry I got back in my car only really thinking about the other fifteen stops I had that day. 

Three days passed and no one has seen or heard from my supervisor. The last message I have from him is a text saying he was walking into that store. I now find it strange that he used the past tense when he asked if I liked my boss. Maybe the owners English wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought. I‚Äôll have to ask him about my suspicions next month when I head back there.

If Pepsi can sell its own individual soda made with real sugar then so can Coca-Cola. 

Yes, yes, I know and am aware that there is Mexican Coke made with real sugar sold in the US, and the Cola Cola's sold in Mexico, United Kingdom, Africa, Middie East, Asia etc are made with either cane sugar or sucralose. 

But the thing is I would like if Coca Cola made a real sugar version of their drinks sold in a can or a plastic bottle just like the one sold in the United Kingdom. 

There are numerous reasons why many people, including myself, believe that returning to using real sugar would be a positive change. Whether it's for health reasons, taste preference, or supporting more natural ingredients, the benefits are clear.

7 months ago I started this petition calling for the change, so far, we've gathered 166 signatures, but we need more support to make a real impact.

If we make this trend, it will put Coca-Cola on notice thus resulted in real sugar to come back on Coca-Cola products served here in the US and US territories, If not sell separate products just like Pepsi Cola made with real sugar but in the case of Coca-Cola, we can call it either Coca Cola made with real sugar or Coca Cola throwback.

If this is a cause you believe in and agree with, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could take a moment to sign the petition and share it with your friends and family. Another thing too share this petition on TikTok, IG, FB, YT and other third party social media platforms. 

Pepsi fans come together and please help us your help will mean a lot.

With a newborn I thought I could use some caffeine, and thought I'd treat myself. It only took one sip to taste the sweeteners. Went to check the ingredients, and indeed, they started partially replacing sugar with sweeteners. Note that I'm in Europe, so no HFCS here. 
Sweeteners are killing sodas, they're disgusting. Seems like Coca-Cola is still made with only sugar, so I guess that's going to be it from now on...

Pepsi Merchandiser Advice ,11,1e9tznr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1e9tznr/pepsi_merchandiser_advice/,28,7/23/2024 7:19,"I recently made a post about sales rep tips for myself, however when I first started with pepsi as a merch I looked for tips/info online, and couldn‚Äôt find much.

Here‚Äôs my thoughts/advice.

Coming from a retail background, I knew what I was getting into. The job isn‚Äôt super hard, it‚Äôs just stocking the shelves, coolers and maintaining your back-stock and then presenting your products by pulling it forward before you leave. 

Being a merch is easy, people who say it‚Äôs ‚Äúhard‚Äù are lazy, that simple. The job definitely has its issues but, so does every single job. 

My advice, once you get a route going start early. Work your back-stock before your truck, if you have one coming. Hit your coolers first thing in the A.M, always. Stay organized, don‚Äôt put an (isle 5 item with isle 6 items), keep it organized by isle. Keep your back-stock as organized as possible, if the rep doesn‚Äôt keep it organized, it‚Äôs not your job to clean their mess. (I tended to clean up their mess a lot) it‚Äôs not worth it. Checkout with the receiver, and the grocery manager or whoever is in charge currently. You don‚Äôt have to every time, but to start with you should. Make sure to cross merchandise products, if you have Gatorade on an end-cap, and the shelf is wiped, pull from the end-cap to fill the shelves. 

my biggest piece of advice, hit Gatorade before you leave, make it one of the last things you do. Stores seem to care way more about Gatorade. If you hit it first, chances are it‚Äôs gone by the time you leave, and the stores think you never filled it. If the store is very busy, hit it twice. lastly, checkout and do a store walk!

Then I discovered a range of drinks called ""cordial"". They're like squash, only more fancy and with a wider range of flavours. Suffice to say they made a drink called ""ginger cordial"": essentially a Ginger-flavoured syrup that you can add to water. It gave me an idea.

A tiny drop of it into a glass of Pepsi Max can bring back an essence of the old Ginger Pepsi Max flavour. The only downsides are that it does make it a lot sweeter, which can be sickening if you add too much cordial, so I'd use it conservatively; and the cordial drink itself isn't the cheapest.

In the shops I've visited I've seen raspberry, mint + lime, pineapple and more cordial drinks, so maybe you could restore your own lost Pepsi Max drinks. I don't know if this will help anyone, but I was pretty chuffed, so here we are.",1

He said he wouldn't endorse me because of my performance, but never specified beyond that. All I knew was that a manager needed to know if I applied internally and he treats my merch team leads like they're supervisors so I thought I'd just tell one of them. Well I applied externally for a sales rep position since I couldn't find the posting internally. I got invited for an interview. Less than 24 hours before the interview, big boss calls me and says I have HR on the line blah blah blah... if you remember our conversation I said I wasn't going to endorse you.. I said I told a manager, he said it had to come from him. I said I wanted my rep involved in this conversation, he said this is a non union position, I said I don't care I don't feel comfortable talking to you anymore.. soon as we got off the call I immediately texted my union rep and explained what happened..

He's been on PTO, he'll be back tomorrow but I want to know if there's something I can do? I've improved massively since I started.. the reason why it bothers me so much is because I applied for a higher up position months ago and I was left alone to do that interview, but that was a bit different circumstances.. so is there a way to fight this?",1

Very physical but easy right? You walk the store see what you need go to the back, and maybe you have a load than you grab what you need and stock the shelves/coolers etc. But for some reason it's just not clicking with me and its starting to make me feel like an idiot. For some background this is my first week by myself, and on top of feeling extremely overwhelmed with all the products that we have I am not finishing all of my stores even when I am working like 12-13 hours. My boss today cut 2 of my stores off my route so I ended up only doing 3 stores and still ended up getting off at 4pm. 

My first stop was at an Albertsons and my god I hate this place. Everything is so cluttered, and its not even the main merch or the sales reps fault the backstock area is literally just Uboats and its a bitch to squeeze in the area, the pallets are stacked so high I can't figure out what I need off of them so I end up just kind of picking at them one by one or bringing one to the floor and only needing like a quarter of the things. It is so frustrating because I know I am not managing my time very well at all.

My second store was a Stater bros and mygod this place is huge. The back area is immaculate though and very organized with all the 12 packs , and everything else striped (except the gatorade). Today there was a 6 pallet load 2 Gatorade, 1 2 liter, 1 miscellaneous, and 2 12 packs. I was really overwhelmed as I basically didn't need any of the 12 packs from the load because we had all of them in the back stock except for some orange crush that was literally in the middle of the pallet so I was confused as to what I should do? Do I break down the pallet just to grab them? Where do I put the rest of the 12 packs? the backstock was literally stacked where I cant reach the top of some of them. I ended up breaking down some of the miscellaneous items like tea, and Gatorades filled that stuff up but still we were missing some and I couldn't figure out if we didn't have the flavors (surely, we must have all the Gatorade flavors if there us 2 pallets right plus like 3 leftover ones) so there I am again wasting time trying to find things. Then like 6 hours later as im getting ready to head out.

Then as I am getting ready to head out the receiver tells me to check out with his boss cuz he will call my boss if anything is missing (I am already 2 hours behind schedule at this point) and I understand that yes, I need to check out with the boss cuz it looks bad to just bounce. I really thought I had done everything. I tell him I didn't do the celsius because we didn't have any (I pulled them all forward) he points out that I forgot the bubbly, damn I totally forgot the bubbly. This is where I start to feel dumb, he then says ""doesn't Pepsi train you guys"" all I can say is ""sorry sir I am new I am still trying to get the hang of things"".  He tells me there was a pallet that I didn't even touch (true) and there it is the bubbly. Right in the middle of one of the Gatorade pallets. I honestly feel kind of like a lazy idiot because In my mind I do remember thinking ""there is no way Im breaking down that whole pallet just to grab the bubbly in the middle"". 

So there you guys have it. Has anyone experienced days like this when you were first starting? does it get better or am I just not cut out for this type of work?

3 months into Merchandising and I gave my 2 weeks,16,1d5cgm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1d5cgm3/3_months_into_merchandising_and_i_gave_my_2_weeks/,31,6/1/2024 9:13,"Being a Merchandiser is the worst job I have ever had, I knew what I was signing up for because I had someone in my family work at Pepsi as a Merchandiser early morning, long days, physical work. The work itself is not bad, boring but whatever pays the bills. 

The real issue I have with this job are 2 major things 

1. I'm a floater, so I show up to stores that other people service on their days off. Let me tell you not once did I have a backroom that was organized and neat, every single account was always a f'ing mess. For the first 2 months I would always make it as neat as possible to try and help them out but now I think the people seem to just not care maybe because they think that the next person will take care of their mess, meaning me. For the last month I said F it and stopped doing that, waste of time not my problem. Ran deliveries and I was off to the next store, didn't even touch backstock. Boss man didn't like that so much.

2. 0 forklift training! Might be different where you guys work I know some people don't even use forklifts but where I work it is a must. Product is always in the rack and needs to be pulled down. Only problem is I have never used a forklift in my life. Mind you I really tried my best to learn it on my own but just could never really teach myself how to use it. Since I'm not even certified I'm not even supposed to be on it. I talked to upper management and my boss about it for 2 weeks straight. Everyday non stop asking for training. I was promised time and time again but it never came. Got to the point where my boss said to me, ""if you don't feel comfortable using the lift don't use it."" Basically saying don't do your job. So I took his advice and store after store would reach out and complain to my company saying I wasn't doing my job. I then would get texts, phone calls, pictures of empty shelfs etc. 

In my mind I wanted to get to the 3 month mark. For some reason I thought it would get better, news flash it just got worse. With it being the start of 100 days of summer it is just way too much. When I gave my 2 weeks my boss gave me the option to have my own route and he said that he will train me on the lift. I then said show me how to use the forklift then I might consider staying. That was a week ago and still no forklift training. Actually next week (my last week) my boss decided it was a great time to take the whole week off. (PTO) 

If you guys are interested in becoming a merchandiser please make sure you get the proper training before they send you on the floor. Don't be so accepting and do what they want you to do, because they will throw you into hell. The second you don't like someone go to your supervisor and I'm telling you it should make a big difference. That's my number 1 piece of advice for someone that is interested in this job, put your foot down and don't get walked over. Know what you want and make it very clear. For me the job is just not worth it, I get paid $21 and I know some people that work at phone stores or even warehouses that are making that if not more. ",1

Question for any pepsi employee...,5,1ccabs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1ccabs9/question_for_any_pepsi_employee/,20,4/25/2024 4:34,"So I was offered a merchandising position, awaiting background check n drug test. All is good on that with no worries.  I had purchased tickets to fly overseas with family with my old company, it is a $3000 trip. My wife has to go sign documents and I need to go with so I can be with our daughter and also we want to enjoy time there. 

So here is the question; Since im going to be on probation for 90 days, will I be able to take off a week of work? I dont expect to get paid vacation. Also would this hurt my attendance record or performance record and possibly be a problem for them to keep me onboard. I dont worry about doing a good job I have experience, I never call off and its rare I ever get sick. What do you guys/girls/others think? I hate to be asking for time off right away thats not normally what I do but this is set in stone date wise and there is a time limit for my wife to sign the documents. ",1

Pepsi Merchandiser,19,1cagyy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1cagyy9/pepsi_merchandiser/,38,4/23/2024 0:38,"Just finished up my 3rd week as a Pepsi Merchandiser and I'm regretting even becoming one in the first place. I'm 20M and previously was working at Menards for 3 years and felt like I needed a change. Was barley getting my 40 hours a week and pay was okay. I applied to Pepsi Merchandiser part time position in hopes of becoming full time in a couple months. I ended up getting the position within a week and started the 1st of April.

So far I have received 0 training its just grab a random pallet and go, the job is very hard on your body. Mind you I have been going to the gym 6 times a week for the past 4 years so I think I know when something is hard on your body. So far I have only had 3 days off, 6 days on 1 day off as part timer. The work itself isn't too bad but one thing that I can't seem to learn quick enough is using the forklift. Co-workers have shown me a brief explanation on how to use it but that's about it. Last Monday I ended up using the forklift for the first time all by myself and I dropped an entire pallet of 24 pack Mtn Dew. Upper management didn't seem too mad at all after that happened. But recently I serviced two stores last weekend and both stores were complaining to management that I didn't fill the shelves and AD displays when I clearly stocked it full. It's finally my day off after 6 days straight and I can't even relax without people from the job blowing up my phone.

It doesn't help either because I'm a floater and I don't service the same stores so when I show up to a store the backroom is always a complete mess and I have to fix it. Man to all you Pepsi Merchandisers I give you a lot of credit. I'm about ready to call it quits and find something else, mind you I'm not a job hopper by any means but call it what you want this job sucks! Also getting paid $18.50 isn't getting me too excited to jump out of bed to work at 5 am.

Citric/phosphoric acid,5,1bfm34j,https://i.redd.it/tefw7a7ftjoc1.jpeg,2,3/16/2024 2:21,"Recently in a Food Theory on the Food Theorists YouTube channel, it was said that the reason Pepsi tastes different from regular coke is because it uses citric acid, instead of phophoric acid. At first I was surprised, because I thought that Pepsi used phosphoric acid, just like every other brand that made cokes/colas. But after looking at the ingredients label on a Pepsi can, it seems like they do actually use phosphoric acid. Or at the very least that seems to be the case for where I live at. Trying to search for the reason for this discrepancy online didn't result to anything, expect some articles trying to describe as to why Pepsi might be different from regular coke (using citric acid as the cause for this) while others where just listing reasons why phosphoric acid in colas is bad for you (also using Pepsi as an example for a drink containing phosphoric acid). At some point I thought maybe this might be a US-only thing, as the Theorists channel is US-based. But I couldn't really find any articles describing this difference. (The only regional differences that they appear to be describing is the different amount of sugar added into this types of drinks across different regions around the world.)

So my question is, does anyone know as to why Pepsi uses different acids for different regions around the world?

(For proof, added a picture of the ingredient label of a Pepsi can, just in case someone might be thinking I'm hallucinating all this stuff. Its in german though, but I think its meaning can be easily discerned if you read it on the label. Alternativelly there is always Google Translate, if you can't get the meaning out of it.)",1

Bidding on Route,1,1ban97o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepsi/comments/1ban97o/bidding_on_route/,18,3/10/2024 0:37,"I‚Äôve been a BCR for pepsi for about seven years and have the highest seniority among the other people. Recently, they did a reroute. The small format reps were given the pay adjustment scale, while the large format reps were not because of an undisclosed wal mart issue. So basically we were forced to bid on our routes without knowing anything about the pay changes. I decided to leave my route for a route that had a Walmart. It turns out four days after we bid we were told that Walmarts will be sending in their own Aquafina and then it won‚Äôt be the pepsi reps job to do so anymore, which might not sound like a lot, but it‚Äôs a large chunk of the volume/commission. This was the ‚Äúundisclosed Walmart issue‚Äù that I referenced in earlier. Also, the pay adjustment lowered our base pay and increased our commission considerably. It really bothered me that we weren‚Äôt given this information before we bid, since now I am taking a big pay cut by leaving my old route. 

My question is, am I justified in asking to rebid? The route changes don‚Äôt happen for two more weeks. I‚Äôve considered getting HR involved but I know that will probably piss off some people, and I am in line to be in management at some point and don‚Äôt want to ruin any chance of a promotion. But I also don‚Äôt know for sure when something will be available.

I already politely asked the BCR who bid on my route if he would let me keep my route and he‚Äôs being a d*ck about it. He has far less seniority than me.

Hi Reddit,

I recently started working as a Pepsi merchandiser, and it's been a physically demanding experience. I typically work from 4 am to 5:15 pm, often needing a second lunch break just to complete my daily tasks.

I'm curious about the career prospects in this field. How quickly can I expect to be promoted, and does the workload improve over time?

Here are some details about my situation:

Physical Strain: My body is struggling with the demands of the job. My back, fingers, wrists, and joints are in constant pain, and I've lost full grip in both hands until I stretch for over an hour each morning. I suspect this might be related to carpal tunnel syndrome, which I developed from my previous gaming hobby.

Workload: The workload is overwhelming, with sales reps often ordering pallets of products that I don't need. As a result, I spend a lot of time digging through pallets to find specific items, which is frustrating and inefficient. For example, at one store, I have three full pallets of Gatorade and eight pallets of other products, even though it's not a large store like Walmart or Costco.

Job Performance: Despite the challenges, I'm proud of the work I do, and the store managers appreciate my efforts. However, the physical strain and inefficient workload are taking a toll on me.

I'm torn between staying and quitting. On one hand, I enjoy the work, but on the other hand, the physical strain and disorganized workload are making it difficult to continue.

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance
